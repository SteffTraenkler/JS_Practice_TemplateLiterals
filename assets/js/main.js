${the} ${lunatic} on the grass<br>
${the} ${lunatic} on the grass<br>
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs<br>
Got to keep the loonies on the path<br>
<br>
${the} ${lunatic} in the ${hall}<br>
${the} lunatics are in my ${hall}<br>
${the} paper holds their folded faces to the floor<br>
${and} every day the ${paperboy} brings more<br>
<br>
<br>
${and} if the dam breaks open many years too soon<br>
${and} if there is no room upon the hill<br>
${and} if your head explodes with dark forebodings too<br>
${darkSide}<br>
<br>
${the} ${lunatic} ${head}<br>
${the} ${lunatic} ${head}<br>
You raise the blade, you make the change<br>
You rearrange me 'til I'm sane<br>
${door}<br>
${and} throw away the key<br>
${the}re's someone ${head} but it's not me<br>
<br>
${and} if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear<br>
You shout and no one seems to hear<br>
${and} if the band you're in starts playing different tunes<br>
${darkSide}<br>
<br>`
